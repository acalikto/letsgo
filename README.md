# Numerical methods for partial differential equations

by Bernard Knaepen & Yelyzaveta Velizhanina

This Github repository contains an introduction to numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. It's divided in several chapters:

* Introduction
* Time integration
* Finite differences
* Partial differential equations
* Iterative methods

The course material is provided in Jupyter notebooks that can be executed on a local machine after installing the required set of Python packages. The full set of installation instructions is available [in a dedicated notebook](https://github.com/aquaULB/solving_pde_mooc/blob/master/notebooks/01_Introduction/01_01_ToolkitSetup.md).

The course can also be accessed through [a static website](https://aquaulb.github.io/book_solving_pde_mooc).
